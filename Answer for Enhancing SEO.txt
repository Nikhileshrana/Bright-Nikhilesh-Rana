If this were a live production site, I would focus on additional SEO improvements to ensure it ranks higher on search engines and attracts more visitors. Here's what I would do:

Performance Boost: Using frameworks like Nextjs which manages major SEO
Content Optimization: I’d ensure that the content is keyword-rich, concise, and relevant to the target audience.
Image Optimization: All images, including the one in website-images, would be compressed for faster loading and have descriptive alt text to improve accessibility and SEO.
Mobile Optimization: While the site is responsive, I’d double-check mobile performance using tools like Lighthouse gives good score.
Meta Tag Enhancements: I'd include Open Graph tags for better sharing on social media and high click rates.
Backlink Strategy: I would establish many backlinks which are relevant so that there could be increase in the ranking of the website.
